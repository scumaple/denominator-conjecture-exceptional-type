We verify denominator conejecture for cluster algebras of exceptional types. Due to the algorithm, it suffices to verify it for type F_4 and E_8.
First run the file 'E8-B-Matrices.ipynb' to get all the non-acyclic B-matrix of type E_8 up to sink-source equivalent(there are 390 matrices, see'E8Bmatrix.sobj'). Then for each B-matrix B[i],
 run the file 'E8-D-matrices.ipynb' to obtain all the D-matrices of B[i], see 'D-Matrix-E-8-part1~8'. Finally, for each file of D-matrices, run the program 'E8-Solving-linear-inequalitiy.ipynb'.
